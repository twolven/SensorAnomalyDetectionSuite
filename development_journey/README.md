# Power Grid Fault Detection Development Journey

## Overview
This directory documents the complete development process of our fault detection system,
from initial exploration to final web deployment.

## Development Phases

### 01_initial_exploration
- Signal analysis and data validation
- Data augmentation development
- Initial feasibility testing

### 02_first_approach
- Multi-model implementation attempt
- Separate detection and classification models
- Initial validation results

### 03_data_analysis
- Comprehensive visual analysis
- Model performance evaluation
- Identification of approach limitations

### 04_final_implementation
- Simplified unified model
- Improved training process
- ONNX conversion for web deployment

### 05_web_deployment
- Browser-based implementation
- Final validation and testing
- Production deployment preparations
